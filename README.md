# SDNThreatMitigationSDK
Threat Mitigation SDK for Software Defined Networks

This SDK has been designed to help sys admins and developers of Software-Defined Networks respond to attacks and threats identified by their Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems.

The Python has been started with the Python Programming Language dur to the fact that a lot of the SDN API's are Python based.
